# Contrasting heat stress response patterns of coral holobionts across the Red Sea suggest distinct mechanisms of thermal tolerance

analysis workflow and scripts for the 'CBASS84' manuscript; broadly separated into:
- PAM Fv/Fm ED50 analysis
- RNA-Seq based coral host single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis
- coral host gene expression (RNA-Seq)
- microalgal gene expression (RNA-Seq)
- microalgal community typing (ITS2, SymPortal)
- bacterial community typing (16S)

The paper is published open access and accessible here https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/mec.16064 

The work integrates coral physiology using the Coral Bleaching Automated Stress System (CBASS) in combination with coral holobiont genomics to elucidate mechanisms of thermal tolerance; it details the Global Search approach (Paul G. Allen Family Foundation)
